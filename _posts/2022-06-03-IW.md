# IW & SIW

## 1. IW (Iterated Width)

- $$IW(k)$$ is a BFS that prunes newly generated states whose *novelty*(*s*) *>* *k*.
- $$IW$$ is a sequence of calls $$IW(k)$$ for $$i=1,2,3,\dots$$ over problem $$P$$ until problem solved or $$i$$ exceeds number of variables in problem.
- IW(1) is a Breadth First Search that prunes generated nodes with novelty > 1. IW(1) **cannot** solve the TSP problem

### 1.1 Novelty

the novelty $$w(s)$$ of state $$s$$ is the **size** of the **smallest subset of atoms** in $$s$$ that is **true** for the first time in the search.

### 1.2 Property of IW

- $$IW(k)$$ expands at most $$O(n^k)$$ states, where $$n$$ is the number of atoms

- simple and blind, is a pretty good algorithm over benchmarks when goals restricted to **single atoms**
- width of benchmarks domains is small for such goals
