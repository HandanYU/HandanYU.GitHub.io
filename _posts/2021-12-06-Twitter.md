title: Twitter Semantics Analysis
summary: three types of sentiment classifiers were built to deal with a 3-way task of
classifying tweet sentiment into positive, neutral, and negative. These classifiers were basedon three different machine learning algorithms, namely Naive Bayes, Softmax Regression, and K Nearest Neighbor. Also, these classifiers were separately examined on both traditional TFIDF and the improved TFIDF combined with information entropy feature selector. Furthermore, the impacts of gender bias on the performances of classifiers were discussed.
