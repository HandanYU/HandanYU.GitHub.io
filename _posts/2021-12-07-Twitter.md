title: Twitter Semantics Analysis
summary: we proposed several binary classifiers to detect rumours in the certain Tweets dataset, which use different pre-trained BERT models and finetuned it on a fully connected neural network based on different feature sets. After that considering different metrics, we combined three models which outperform in the development and test dataset and applied it to classify the certain tweets related to COVID-19 topics. According to the results of classification, statistical analysis would be performed.
